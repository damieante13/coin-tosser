Note that you will need to download or create images to use to display face-up or face-down coins for the toHTML method. Create a folder directory named images in your repository to hold them.

Test and demonstrate that your coin object is complete by doing the following:

    Write a function called display20Flips that uses a loop to flip the coin 20 times. Each time the coin flips, display the result of each flip as a string on the page (make use of your toString() method)

    Write a function called display20Images, again using a loop to flip the coin 20 timesâ€¦but this time instead of displaying the result as a string, display the result of each flip as an HTML IMG element on the page (make use of your toHTML() method).

Your HTML file should have nothing in the body except for your script tag. Instead of hard-coding HTML elements, create them dynamically with Javascript and append them to your HTML using document.createElement and ParentNode.append
